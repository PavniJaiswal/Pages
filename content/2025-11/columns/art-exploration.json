I would spend days trying to get portraits and landscapes as real as I can: the perfect shadow, the exact proportion, the texture of light. There was a sense of achievement in accuracy, as if painting reality better somehow meant understanding it better.\n\nBut with time, it changed….\n\nAs I learnt more about the history of art, my genre of interest started shifting. One period that fascinated me the most is the dramatic shift in painting styles that occurred with the invention of photography in the 19th century. Suddenly, painters were no longer responsible for capturing perfect realism. The camera could document faces, objects, and landscapes far more accurately than a brush ever could. This technological disruption pushed artists to rethink their purpose.\n\nFreed from capturing reality, artists began exploring the things a camera couldn’t see:\nmovement instead of clarity,\nemotion instead of accuracy,\nbrush strokes captured much more than what was just visible to the eye…\n\nThis is where, in the late 19th century, impressionism shimmered into existence, strokes that danced more than they described. And from there, art continued to evolve into abstraction, surrealism, and the many expressive forms we see today. It wasn’t a decline from realism; it was an expansion of imagination.\n\nIn the next article, I want to take you into one such painting, a work that sits right at this crossroads of freedom, rebellion, and feeling. A painting that once confused critics and challenged norms.\n\nTake a guess or wait to get impressed <3"
