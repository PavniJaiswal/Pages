Nearly 35000 runs in 660 matches spanning over 25 years, 100 international centuries, orange cap in IPL, first 200 in ODIs, these numbers define the longevity of the career across generations. But Tendulkar’s greatness wasn’t just confined to statistics or moments on the field. His real legacy lies beyond the boundary ropes. He is one of the core elements of the reaction that reshaped Indian cricket’s heartbeat off the field - transforming fan culture, inspiring generations, and revolutionizing cricket’s commercial and economic landscape. Things that have formed a cyclic loop that will only fuel Indian cricket onwards and upwards.\n\n### Fan Support: Crafting a Cricketing Nation\n\nThere’s no doubt that 1983 ignited the cricket fandom in India. But it was propelled by Tendulkar. Before Tendulkar’s era, Indian cricket’s popularity was regionally very strong, but lacked the unified mass appeal it commands today. The superstar power of Tendulkar brought cricket into the heart of millions of Indians across diverse demographics, making the sport a cultural phenomenon. Streets would be deserted when he walked out to bat; businesses would shut, and families would pause their routines—this deep, almost religious following was unique.\nFormer Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar once remarked, “Sachin transcended the game itself; he brought pureness, integrity, and passion to Indian cricket that connected with every Indian”. The emotional connect created by Tendulkar united a dedicated but fragmented fan base, bringing cricket from being a sport played and watched in clusters to a national obsession.\nThis fan support not only brought people to stadiums, but drove the culture forward. These are the foundations of which the Indian cricket team receives massive support globally, wherever they play. It also motivates the current players, and the cycle continues.\n\n### Inspirational Beacon for Cricketers\n\nOn the professional front, Tendulkar set new standards for Indian cricket. His relentless work ethic, humility, and discipline inspired modern greats like Virat Kohli, who noted, “Sachin’s dedication and passion were unmatched. Watching him taught me what it takes to be the best”. Tendulkar’s presence nurtured professionalism and mentorship within the team culture, helping Indian cricket transform from inconsistent performances to global dominance. His leadership style influenced successors like MS Dhoni, who credited Tendulkar’s role in fostering a confident, balanced team ethos. His role in mentoring younger players continues post-retirement, with many emerging cricketers citing Tendulkar’s example as a key factor in their development.\n\n### Driving Commercial and Economic Growth\n\nIndian cricket’s commercial landscape prior to Tendulkar was modest, with limited broadcasting deals and sponsorships. The boom in cricket’s finances coincided with Tendulkar’s meteoric rise. The advent of satellite television in the 1990s coupled with Tendulkar’s superstar charisma massively increased cricket’s marketability. “As India’s economy changed, Tendulkar is a product of a new economy whereas Gavaskar was a product of a licensed, socialism-driven economy. He (Gavaskar) batted like he had bank deposits whereas Tendulkar bats like he’s playing on the equity markets.” This was Harsha Bhogle’s statements on Tendulkar, which resonated with the fans of that time.\nUntil the late 1990s, the BCCI was not able to capitalize financially on cricket broadcast; in fact, it paid Doordarshan, the state broadcaster, to air matches. The watershed moment came in 1998, when Doordarshan was granted the rights to telecast India’s home series for a fee, marking the beginning of a commercial relationship. Today, IPL broadcasting rights for 2023-2027 fetches approximately ₹47,333 crore, illustrating the financial heights Indian cricket has reached.\nFormer England cricketer Nasser Hussain stated, “Indian cricket’s financial muscle today can be traced back to the era when Tendulkar became a household name. His presence made the sport commercially viable like never before”.\n\n### The Virtuous Cycle: Sustaining Indian Cricket's Powerhouse\nIn today’s day and age, these interdependent forces create a virtuous cycle, each one amplifying the others. Fan passion boosts commercial returns, which fund player development and player motivation. This drives performance and results, making the team more competitive and appealing, which in turn deepen fan engagement and fuel the system with more revenue. Not only this, today, the match fees for Ranji Trophy, the domestic tournament of India, is around ₹50000. This allows up and coming players to focus on international cricket without worrying about financial sustenance. And the IPL attracts the global crowd and players to further nurture Indian cricket. Tendulkar’s rise was the one of the core drivers that started this cycle. More than his already illustrious numbers and on-field contributions, this is the true legacy of the God of Cricket."
