The quiet evenings. The unremarkable Tuesdays.\nThis is life. Not the exception, but the rule.\n\n## On Dying\n\nWe avoid talking about death.\nAs if silence could keep it away.\nAs if not naming it means it won't come.\n\nBut death is patient.\nIt doesn't need our acknowledgment.\nIt waits, inevitable, at the end of every story.\n\nMaybe if we talked about it more, we'd fear it less.\nMaybe if we acknowledged its presence, we'd appreciate life's.\n\n## Everything In Between\n\nBetween birth and death, we collect moments:\n\n*First loves and last goodbyes.*\n*Victories and failures.*\n*Wounds and healings.*\n*Connections and losses.*\n\nWe are not just the big moments.\nWe are also the small ones:\n\n*Morning coffee. Evening walks. Shared laughter. Silent tears.*\n\n## A Memory\n\nI remember holding my grandmother's hand as she died.\nHer breath slowing, slowing, stopping.\nThe room suddenly too quiet.\nThe world irrevocably changed.\n\nIn that moment, I understood:\nLife is not the opposite of death.\nThey're partners in the same dance.\n\nEvery breath we take is both life continuing and death approaching.\nEvery moment we live is practice for the moment we won't.\n\n## The Weight of Being\n\nExistence is heavy sometimes.\nThe weight of consciousness. The burden of awareness.\nKnowing we will die. Knowing those we love will die.\nKnowing everything we build will crumble.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nAnd yet, we wake up. We make coffee. We call our friends.\nWe fall in love. We create. We hope.\n\nPerhaps that's the bravest thing—\nLiving fully while knowing nothing lasts.\n\n## Gratitude and Grief\n\nThey taught me gratitude and grief are twins.\nYou can't have one without the other.\n\nI'm grateful for everyone I've loved—\nWhich means I'll grieve them when they're gone.\n\nI'm grateful for this life—\nWhich means I'll grieve leaving it.\n\nGratitude is joy tinged with the knowledge of impermanence.\nGrief is love that has nowhere left to go.\n\n## What Remains\n\nWhen we die, what remains?\n\nMemories in others' minds. Photos in albums. Stories told and retold.\nThe ways we changed people. The love we gave. The kindness we showed.\n\nOr maybe nothing remains. Maybe we simply return to whatever we came from.\n\nEither way, what matters is this:\nWhat are we doing with the time we have?\n\n## A Poem for the Living\n\n*You are alive right now.*\n*Reading these words.*\n*Breathing these breaths.*\n\n*Your heart is beating.*\n*Your blood is flowing.*\n*Your consciousness is conscious.*\n\n*This is not rehearsal.*\n*This is not the warm-up.*\n*This is it.*\n\n*Life. Death. Everything in between.*\n*All happening now.*\n*All happening to you.*\n\n*So what will you do with this moment?*\n*And the next one?*\n*And the one after that?*\n\n## The Question\n\nIf you knew you'd die tomorrow, what would you do today?\n\nThe classic question. But here's the truth:\nYou don't know you won't.\n\nNone of us do.\n\nSo maybe the better question is:\nWhat kind of life are you living right now?\n\nIs it the one you want?\nOr the one you've settled for?\n\n## Everything Matters, Nothing Matters\n\nIn the grand scheme—cosmic time, universal scale—none of this matters.\nWe are specks on a speck, existing for less than a blink.\n\nAnd yet.\n\nTo us, it matters tremendously.\nThis life. These loves. These moments.\n\nMaybe meaning isn't found. Maybe it's made.\nMaybe the fact that we won't last forever doesn't diminish our value—\nIt intensifies it.\n\n## An Ending (Which Is Also a Beginning)\n\nSomeday, I will die.\nSo will you.\nSo will everyone we know.\n\nBut today, we are alive.\n\nAnd that's enough.\nThat's everything.\n\nLife, death, and everything in between—\nIt's all we have.\nIt's all we need.\n\n---\n\n*For everyone navigating the beautiful, terrible space between birth and death.*"
